### Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-Machine-Learning
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a medical condition of the eye that is caused by diabetes. It is one of
the leading causes for blindness in the working age population. It's caused by damage to the blood
vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Eventually, it can cause blindness.
The objective of our thesis is to detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy by applying ensemble
of machine learning classifying algorithms on features extracted from output of different retinal
image. It will give us accuracy of which algorithm will be suitable and more accurate for prediction
of the disease. Decision making for predicting the presence of diabetic retinopathy is performed
using Support Vector Machine and K- nearest Neighbour algorithms.
